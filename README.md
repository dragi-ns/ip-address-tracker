### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load (This is disabled due to the CORS)
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
